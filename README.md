Leonidas is a Discord bot, originally made by [germainechu](http://github.com/germainechu) and I, with the goal of making it easier for students to join group chats for their courses. It was designed to work for [UBC](http://ubc.ca) students and courses but could be easily extended to other universities. We noticed that students were posting in various Facebook groups asking to be added to group chats for their courses. They'd then have to wait for someone in one of the classes to happen accross their post and add them. 

Leonidas verifies that users (students, profs, TAs, etc.) have university-associated emails and then adds them to their requested courses automatically.
